What is Heap ?
    A Heap is a Tree-based Data Structure in 
the tree is a complete binary tree.

There are two type:
1. Max Heap
    In the Max Heap the value of the root node must be
    the greatest among al its child nodes and the same
    thing be done for its left and right sub-tree also.

Notes:- The total number of comparisons required in the max 
heap is according to the height of the tree.
The height of the complete binary tree is always 
logn; therefore, the time complexity would also 
be O(logn).

2. Min-Heap: 
    In this heap, the value of the root node must be the
    smallest among all its child nodes and the same
    thing must be done for its left and right sub-tree
    also.

Notes:- The total number of comparisons required in the min
heap is according to the height of the tree. The
height of the complete binary tree is always logn;
therefore, the time complexity would also be
O(logn).

* For Heapify its takes O(Log N) 
* Insertion its takes O(Log N)
* Deletion its takes O(Log N)
